# dotfiles

Used to use the [thoughtbot dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles), creating my own now.

Ideas stolen from [estrattonbailey](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/.dotfiles), [meowgorithm](https://github.com/meowgorithm/dotfiles), and [muesli](https://github.com/muesli/dotfiles).
